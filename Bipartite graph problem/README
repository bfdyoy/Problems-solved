A fortress has multiple types of towers: attack and
defense towers. Between any pair of towers, there may or may not be a tunnel.
Suppose we have n towers and we have a list of r pairs of towers for which there
are tunnels. Implement an O(n+r)-time algorithm that determines whether it is
possible to assign some of the towers as attack and the remaining ones as defense
towers such that each tunnel is between an attack and a defense tower. If it
is possible to perform such a designation, your implemented algorithm should
produce it.
