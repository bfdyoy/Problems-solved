N children play the well-known ala-bala-portocala game.
They are placed on a circle and start counting from 1 to k. The k-th child is
removed from the game. The process continues with the rest of the children,
each time counting from 1 up to k, until all the children are removed from the
game. Implement an efficient algorithm for printing out the order in which the
children are removed from the game using a circular list.
