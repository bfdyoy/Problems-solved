Take a sequence of 2n real numbers as input. Design an
O(n log n) algorithm that partitions the numbers into n pairs, with the property
that the partition minimizes the maximum sum of a pair. For example, say we
are given the numbers (1,6,3,7), the possible partitions are ((1,6), (3,7)), ((1,3),
(6,7)) and ((1,7), (3,6)). The pair sums for these partitions are (4,13), (7,10),
and (8,9). Thus, the third partition has 9 as its maximum sum, which is the
minimum over the three partitions.
